# !This is an extension just for fun!
**How it works:**

Load a page and it will take a screenshot of current Tab,
saving it to a folder with following structure

```
downloads
└───progress-capture
│   └───hostname
│       └───path
│       │   current date + time
│       │   ...
```

**TODO:** 
- [ ] Add icons for the Extension 
- [ ] Toggle on/off for specific pages
